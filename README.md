    ###DATABASE GENERATION
    ##### shoes[stores[id, 'name'], brands[id, 'brand'], shoes_stores[id, store_id, brand_id]]<br />

    To create the database from the included sql file, open a command-line window to the project root and start psql. Then create the database 'shoes' and /c into it. Now import the sql data with the \i command and the name of the sql file.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE shoes;
    \c shoes;
    \i shoes.sql;
    ```

    Alternatively, create the working and test databases using the following series of commands: <br/>

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE shoes;
    \c shoes;
    CREATE TABLE stores (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name varchar);
    CREATE TABLE brands (id serial PRIMARY KEY, brand varchar);
    CREATE TABLE stores_brands (id serial PRIMARY KEY, store_id int, brand_id int);
    CREATE DATABASE shoes_test WITH TEMPLATE shoes;
    \c shoes_test;
    ```
